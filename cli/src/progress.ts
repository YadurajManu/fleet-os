/**
 * Following a deploy.

 * `POST /services/:id/deploy` is a single request that can take minutes: it builds
 * for every architecture in the fleet, pushes to the registry, allocates a port
 * and hands the container to an agent. The control plane now walks the deployment
 * row through those phases and publishes the build's own sub-step alongside it
 * (control-plane/src/api/deploy-progress.ts), so the CLI can poll for them while
 * it waits on the request it already has in flight, and show where the work has
 * actually got to instead of guessing.
 *
 * Progress is decoration, never the result: a poll that fails is swallowed and the
 * deploy carries on. Only `awaitRunning`, where a poll *is* the mechanism, treats
 * a persistently unreachable control plane as an error.
