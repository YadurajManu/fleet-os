/**
 * A progress ladder: several named steps sharing one redraw region, each
 * settling in place as it completes.
 *
 * This exists because a stack of independent spinners cannot answer the only
 * question an operator has during a four-minute deploy — where am I. Completed
 * steps stay on screen, the active step carries the clock, and the steps still to
 * come are listed from the start, so the shape of the whole operation is legible
 * before it has finished.
 *
 * The two rules from ui.ts still hold. Everything here goes to stderr, so `--json`
 * on stdout stays pipeable into jq. And every animated form has a plain-line
 * transcript equivalent, so a CI log reads as a sequence of events rather than as
 * a smear of cursor escapes.
