/**
 * The founder page.
 *
 * Deliberately not a PAGES entry: the doc shell gives every page a breadcrumb,
 * a "last updated" stamp and a table of contents, and all three are wrong for
 * this. Nobody wants a table of contents for a person.
 *
 * The argument the page has to make is narrow. Fleet OS asks for your machines,
 * your registry credentials and your customers' data. One person maintains it.
 * That is either disqualifying or it is the reason to trust it, and the only
 * way to land on the second is to be specific about both halves — which is why
 * "what one person can't give you" is on the page at the same size as what it
 * can.
