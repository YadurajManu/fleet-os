/**
 * Routing on real paths, with hash routing still honoured.
 *
 * Hash routing was chosen because it needs no server config and works from a
 * static bucket. The cost is that everything after `#` is never sent to the
 * server, so a crawler asking for /docs/fleet-yaml receives the same empty
 * shell and the same <title> as the homepage — twenty pages of documentation
 * that, as far as a search engine is concerned, do not exist.
 *
 * So paths are now primary and prerendered at build time, and `#/route` is
 * still accepted: every link already published, in every README and every
 * shared message, keeps working.
