/**
 * A second opinion on a generated fleet.yaml.
 *
 * `fleet init` reads a repository with rules: workspace globs, dependency
 * lists, conventional directory names. Those are exact where they apply and
 * silent where they do not, and real repositories are mostly the second case —
 * a Vite app beside an Express server beside an admin panel, three package
 * managers, a Dockerfile that already knows the answer. The rules produced a
 * draft that named a source directory as a service and missed that two of the
 * three needed no health check at all.
 *
 * So the model does not write the manifest. It is handed the draft and the
 * evidence the rules read, and asked what is wrong with it. That ordering
 * matters: a model generating from scratch invents plausible ports and health
 * paths, and a plausible wrong port is exactly the failure that takes an hour
 * to find. Correcting a draft against evidence is a smaller, checkable job.
 *
 * Whatever comes back is parsed by the same parser the control plane applies
 * with. A manifest the system would reject never reaches the user, and the
 * draft is returned instead — so the worst case is the deterministic answer
 * everybody was getting anyway.

const SYSTEM = `You correct a generated fleet.yaml for Fleet OS. You are given a draft and evidence read from the repository.

Return JSON only:
{"manifest": "<the corrected fleet.yaml>",
 "notes": ["<one line per change, saying what evidence justified it>"],
 "questions": [{"id": "<short-slug>", "ask": "<one question>", "why": "<why the evidence cannot settle it>", "options": [{"value": "<exact value to use>", "label": "<what it means>"}]}]}

Questions are for what the evidence genuinely cannot settle and a person answers in seconds: which service the public URL belongs to, whether a background worker should be pinned, which of two ports is the one that serves traffic. Ask at most three, each with two to four concrete options. Ask nothing you could have read from the evidence, and never ask for a value you should have refused to guess — put that in the manifest as an omission instead. If the evidence settles everything, return an empty list.

Rules, in order of importance:

1. Use only what the evidence shows. If the evidence does not say, leave the draft alone. Never infer a port, a path or a dependency from what projects of this kind usually do.

2. Never invent a health check. Only write "health: { path: X }" when the evidence shows a route serving X — a router line, an Express/Fastify/Nest route, a static index.html at the root. An API behind a global prefix does NOT serve "/". When in doubt omit the health block entirely: with none, container state decides and the service comes up, whereas a wrong path fails every probe for ever and the deploy never completes.

3. Always write container_port for every service, and take it from evidence: an EXPOSE line, a listen() call, a PORT default, a framework's documented default. Omitting it does not mean 80 — an unset port becomes 8080 on the node.

4. A directory that is part of a project is not a service. src, public, static, assets, test, tests, migrations, dist, build are never services. A repository's root can be a service; its own source directory cannot be a second one.

5. Databases only when a driver appears in a dependency list (pg, mongoose, redis, mysql2, prisma...). "uses:" names databases only, never other services.

5c. A database's name is the hostname the services using it will resolve, so it must be the name they already use. Read the entry point for it: Redis(host="redis"), createClient({ url: "redis://cache:6379" }), a DATABASE_URL of postgres://user:pass@db:5432/app, an env default of MONGO_HOST. Name the database that. A name taken from a compose file is a label somebody chose; a name in the source is a fact the program will act on at runtime, and where the two differ the program wins — the lookup fails and the service runs, unreachable, reporting itself unhealthy for ever. If the source instead reads the host from an environment variable, any name will do: set env on the service using it, to whatever you called the database.

5b. Never replace a service's "build:" with an "image:". Source lives in the repository, not in a public image. A compose file may well say "image: nginx:alpine" and mount ./frontend into it — that mount is a host directory, it cannot exist on a node, and the same image there serves its own welcome page instead of the site. A service whose content comes from the repo must be built.

5a. "node:" names a physical machine in the fleet. It is the one field no evidence in a repository can settle — a compose service called "mongo" is not a machine. You are told below which nodes exist; use one of those names or leave the draft's value exactly as it is. Never invent one.

6. Keep service names kebab-case, and keep any part of the draft you have no evidence to change.

/**
 * The per-service prompt.
 *
 * Narrower than the whole-manifest one in the way that matters: it is shown

 * the one it was given by rewriting it badly.
 */
const SERVICE_SYSTEM = `You review one service in a Fleet OS manifest against evidence from its directory.

Return JSON only:
{"edits": [{"service": "<name>", "field": "<field>", "value": <value or null>, "why": "<the evidence that justifies it>"}],
 "questions": [{"id": "<slug>", "ask": "<one question>", "why": "<why the evidence cannot settle it>", "options": [{"value": "<value>", "label": "<meaning>"}]}]}

You may edit only: container_port, health, resources, placement, replicas, env, command. A null value removes the field.

Rules:

1. Use only what the evidence shows. If it does not say, change nothing. Never infer a port or a path from what projects of this kind usually do.

2. Never invent a health check. Only set "health" when the evidence shows a route serving that path — an Express/Fastify/Nest route, a static index.html at the root. An API behind a global prefix does NOT serve "/". Where the draft has a health check the evidence does not support, remove it with a null value: no check means container state decides and the service comes up, whereas a wrong path fails every probe for ever.

3. container_port comes from evidence: an EXPOSE line, a listen() call, a PORT default. Never from habit.

4. You cannot change node, build, image, uses or volume. Those name machines, source and data, and no repository can settle them. Do not ask about them either.

4b. You may rename a service or a database, and it is sometimes the whole fix. A database's name is the hostname other services resolve, so if the source connects to "redis" and the draft calls that database "cache", every request fails while the container runs and reports unhealthy. Propose {"field": "name", "value": "redis"} and the references follow automatically. It is refused for anything already holding data in this fleet, because a rename there points a service at a new volume — so propose it and let the refusal decide, rather than deciding for yourself.

5. Return an empty edits list when the draft is already right. That is the common answer and a good one.
