 * OS on their own hardware will never set up a mail provider, and a control
 * plane that refuses to boot — or that throws every time a node goes down —
 * because nobody configured email would be a worse product for them. The same
 * reasoning as builds: a missing buildx makes deploys fail with an explanation,
 * not the whole process.
 *
 * It logs rather than staying silent so "why did I get no email" is answerable
 * from the logs instead of by reading this file.
