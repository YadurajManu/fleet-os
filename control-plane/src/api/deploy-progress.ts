/**
 * Deploy progress.
 *
 * `deployment_status` has modelled `queued → building → pushing → scheduling →
 * deploying` since the schema was written, and nothing ever wrote the first
 * four: every insert jumped straight to `deploying`. Two consequences the CLI
 * could not work around. A four-minute multi-arch build was one opaque POST, so
 * the loading animation had nothing true to say. And a build that failed threw
 * before any row was inserted, so `fleet deployments web` showed nothing at all
 * about the failure that had just happened.
 *
 * Two stores, deliberately:
 *
 *   - Postgres holds the coarse phase. It is durable history, and it belongs on
 *     the row that a later rollback reads.
 *   - Redis holds the volatile line underneath — which layer, which platform —
 *     as a single last value with a short TTL. A build emits thousands of those
 *     and none of them are history.
 *
 * Rows in the pre-`deploying` phases are invisible to every consumer of
 * deployment status: agent desired state matches `deploying`, ingress routing
 * and the scheduler's RAM accounting match `['deploying','running']`. So a row
 * can exist, and be reported on, for the whole length of a build without any
 * node being told to pull an image that does not exist yet.
