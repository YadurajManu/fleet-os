 * nothing in the fleet can take it, in which case rescheduleFromNode writes
 * `failed` / `no_eligible_node` and moves on. That is accurate at the time and
 * wrong a moment later: a strand is a statement about capacity right now, not
 * a property of the service. Nothing revisited it, so on a single-node fleet
 * every flexible service stayed dead after its node came back, while pinned
 * ones were resumed. Recovering meant redeploying by hand, and nothing in the
 * fleet said that was needed.
 *
 * Retried here because a node returning is the event most likely to have
 * created the capacity. It is not the only one — a new node, or a service
 * being removed, frees capacity too — so this is where a strand is most often
 * cleared, not the only place it ever could be.
 *
 * Services that are already live are skipped, and a strand that still cannot
 * be placed is left exactly as it is: retried again next time, with no churn
 * and no second failure row.
