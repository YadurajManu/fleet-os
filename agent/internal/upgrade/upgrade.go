// Package upgrade replaces the agent's own binary with the one the control
// plane serves.
//
// Without this, an agent is whatever version it was installed at, forever. The
// only way to move it was `install.sh --reset`, which re-pairs the node and
// discards its history — so on a fleet of any size, every agent improvement
// was undeliverable to the machines that already existed.
//
// The identity here is the binary's SHA-256, not a version string. The control
// plane serves exactly one build per platform and publishes SHA256SUMS beside
// it, so "am I the build being served" is a question with an exact answer,
// where a version string is a claim that can be stale, forged, or simply
// forgotten at build time.
//
// Nothing here runs the downloaded file. It is verified, staged in the state
// directory, and installed by a privileged pre-start step in the unit — the
// agent itself runs under ProtectSystem=strict and cannot write to
// /usr/local/bin, which is deliberate and worth keeping.
